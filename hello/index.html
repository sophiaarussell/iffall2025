    </body>

 <p>2. Required to for my communication design major in Sam Fox.</p>
    </body>

<p>3. I do not have much experience with coding. I took a few classes in highschool but we focused on the basics and it was a while ago.</p>
    </body>

<p>4. I hope to learn more about web design in order to better understand what is happening when I am working on designing a website whether that be the graphics or the concepts.</p>
    </body>

<p>5. I expect designing for screen to be more difficult than on paper because you have to focus on both the design aspects of designing a website as well as the technical aspects like how you are actually going to create something and make it functional.</p>

<p>6. I think that the MullenLowe website is extremely well designed. https://us.mullenlowe.com/. It is not only visually appealing and enticing but also interactive and not stationary which makes the viewer more intruiged and want to explore. Additionally, in my opinion it showcases the branding they have done for themselves very nicely before they begin to highlight the work that they have done .</p>

<p>7. I think that the Patagonia website has good communication. https://www.patagonia.com/home/. It effectively communicates their mission to help to save the planet with phrases like "the earth is now our only shareholder" at the top of the page. The menu bar also effectively communicates their products and organizes their offerings. First option on the menu bar is shop which has all the different categories of products making them easily findable, then there is activism which shows where you can learn about their activism initiatives. Then it moves into the various sports a customer might need gear for and finishes off with story "which focuses on their customer and employee community. Overall, I think this is a website that effectively uses communication to highlight their brand identiy and the products they offer.</p>
